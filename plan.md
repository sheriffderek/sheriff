# Current plan...

1. I'm mostly just making this version of my website to practice explode route transitions with liquid fire.
2. However, I'd like to consume my writing from a CMS. I haven't found an elegant way to write / and also include example components in-line. I was hoping that I could use Prismic - but it's not ticking all of the boxes. For now, I'm just going to plan the site out as if my ideal situation existed - and then see what I can make fit.
3. So... I'll need to outline some models first. 'article' I suppose.
4. Then I'll need the routes. I already have the categories outlined.

- welcome (home route) application-index > transitionTo('welcome')
- - contact
- - articles (seed those - for now, from a JSON file?)
- - - Guidance (that type of article)
- - - Design (etc.)
- - - Implementation (code etc)

That should be a good start.
