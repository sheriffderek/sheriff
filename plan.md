# Current plan...

THE GOAL: Have all my writing live somewhere respectable - and practice custom liquid fire transitions.

## notes

- It took about 3 hours to get everything that is here so far, in place.
- Things like the dynamic routes aren't ember-data style / but they are doing the trick for my purpose.
- I could technically just write all my articles in that (not legit) JSON-like object I have.
- The goal would be to eventually take what I have - and show it to the prismic people / to see if I can get parody.
- Now it's time to start playing with some liquid fire explodes! : )
